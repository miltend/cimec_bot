# cimec_bot
This is a telegram chatbot that crawls the CIMeC main page and offers an information of the latest news or events.

The chatbot link: https://t.me/cimec_info_bot

The main code file: cimec_bot.py

We deploy the chatbot on Heroku using Flask.
Necessary files in the directory needed for Heroku to run the app:

Procfile – a text file for Heroku to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start the app;

requirements.txt – the list of non-built-in Python libraries with versions for Heroku to install;

runtime.txt – to specify which Python version to use.
